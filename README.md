# Image_detection_using_keras
This project can predict if given image belongs to following 10 classes:-
    1: "Car",
    2: "Bird",
    3: "Cat",
    4: "Deer",
    5: "Dog",
    6: "Frog",
    7: "Horse",
    8: "Boat",
    9: "Truck",
    10: "Plane"



Pre requisites:
modules required: - 
Keras
matplotlib
Pathlib
numpy 

after training
predict ur image class using:-
makingPredictions- replace <image_name> in line 31 with your test image

PS :- neural_net.py is only for understanding neural net architecture
       whole training and saving weights will take place from trainingAndSavingModel.py
